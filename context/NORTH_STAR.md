# Nook — North Star

## One-liner
Nook is a marketplace that lets people reserve calm, professional spaces to work by the hour — bringing structure and trust to a behavior that already exists (working from cafés, hotel lobbies, and other shared public environments). In simple terms: **Resy for workspaces**.

## The problem we solve
People want to work in beautiful public places, but today it’s unreliable:
- Will there be a seat?
- Is it okay to stay for hours?
- Is it quiet enough for real work?
- Is there Wi-Fi and power?
Nook makes the experience predictable, trusted, and professional.

## The promise
When a user books on Nook, they should feel:
- I will have a seat.
- I belong here.
- This place supports real work.
- I’m not guessing.

## What Nook is
- A two-sided marketplace for reservable workspaces
- Coffee shops and hotel lobbies first
- Inventory is seats at tables, booked hourly
- Instant confirmation when availability exists
- Monetization begins with per-booking fees

## Differentiation
- Clarity and confidence around availability and pricing
- Work-first positioning (not dining-first)
- Calm, modern UX designed for productivity

## Long-term vision
Nook becomes the default “work layer” for cities:
- Trusted map of workspaces
- Standardized expectations (quiet, calls, duration)
- Payments, reviews, subscriptions
- Venue analytics and yield tools
- Integrations with POS, property systems, Wi-Fi

## Principles
1. Trust is the product.
2. Clarity over cleverness.
3. Calm UI.
4. Two-sided empathy.
5. Build rails for the future.
