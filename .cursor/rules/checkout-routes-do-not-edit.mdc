# Checkout route.ts — Do Not Edit

**Never modify, refactor, or touch any code in `route.ts` files under a `checkout` path.**

- Do not edit these files when implementing features, fixing bugs, or refactoring.
- Do not suggest changes, add comments, or update dependencies in these files.
- If a task would require changing a checkout route, stop and tell the user that checkout route files are off-limits.

This applies to any file matching `**/checkout/**/route.ts` (e.g. `app/api/payments/checkout/route.ts`).
